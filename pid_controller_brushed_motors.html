      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>Updated 15/11/2022. In this sample paper, Open seasons Co., Inc. describes the elctronic design DC motor controllers and a PID controll system  </p>

      <h2>Control Systems </h2>
      <p>
        <p>A control system is defined as a system of devices that manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems to achieve a desired result. A control system achieves this through control loops, which are a process designed to maintain a process variable at a desired set point.</p>
        <span style="color: red;">A system, which controls other systems.</span>
      </p>

      <h2>Requirements of a control system:</h2>
     <p>Accuracy: Accuracy is the measurement tolerance of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions.
    </p>
      <p> Sensitivity: The parameters of a control system are always changing with the change in surrounding conditions, internal disturbance, or any other parameters.
This change can be expressed in terms of sensitivity. Any control system should be insensitive to such parameters but sensitive to input signals only.
</p><p>Noise: An undesired input signal is known as noise. A good control system should be able to reduce the noise effect for better performance.
</p><p>Stability: It is an important characteristic of the control system. For the bounded input signal, the output must be bounded and if the input is zero then the output must be zero then such a control system is said to be a stable system.
</p><p>Bandwidth: An operating frequency range decides the bandwidth of the control system. Bandwidth should be as large as possible for the frequency response of a good control system.
</p><p>Speed: It is the time taken by the control system to achieve its stable output. A good control system possesses high speed. The transient period for such a system is very small.
</p><p>Oscillation: A small number of oscillations or constant oscillations of output tends to indicate the system to be stable.

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>A closed loop control system is called an automatic control system.  
        In any control system, the output is affected due to a change in environmental conditions or any kind of disturbance. So one signal is taken from the output and is fed back to the input.
        This signal is compared with a reference input and the error signal is generated. This error signal is applied to the controller and the output is corrected. Such a system is called a feedback system.When the feedback signal is positive then the system called a positive feedback system. For a positive feedback system, the error signal is the addition of a reference input signal and a feedback signal.
        When the feedback signal is negative then the system is called a negative feedback system. For the negative feedback system, the error signal is given by the difference between the reference input signal and the feedback signal.</p>

    <h1>PID CONTROLLER</h1>
    <p>PID (proportional integral derivative) controllers use a control loop feedback mechanism to control process variables and are the most accurate and stable controller.
        The output of a PID controller, which is equal to the control input to the plant, is calculated in the time domain from the feedback error 
    </p>

    <h1>Euler angles and MPU6040 IMU</h1>
    <p>We will have the acceleration of the 3 axes: X, Y and Z, the three dimensions of our 3D space. Let's just call for example, the IMU movement upwards, the Z axis, forward and backward the Y axis and side to side the X axis. Earth's gravity has an acceleration of approx. 9.8 m / s², perpendicular to the ground. Therefore, the IMU also detects the acceleration of terrestrial gravity. But the values that we get from the IMU won't be in "g" units. This module works with 8 bits registers. Each acceleration value is stored in two registers, low and high bits. The sum of this registers give us 16 bits of data. This data will have a maximum of 16 bits so we will have a 2^16=65536 maximum acceleration value including the positive or negative sign. If we read the datasheet of this module we will find that "1g" equals to 16384. So if we read the acceleration value and divide that value to 16384 we obtain the acceleration in "g" units.Thanks to terrestrial gravity you can use the accelerometer readings to know the angle of inclination with respect to the X axis or Y axis.Suppose the IMU is perfectly aligned with the floor. Then, as you can see in the picture below, the Z axis will be 1g=9.8, and the other two axes will be 0. Now suppose we turn the IMU 90 degrees. Now it is the X axis that is perpendicular to the ground, therefore it will mark the acceleration of 1g gravity.We know that the gravity is 9.8 m / s², and we know how to measure the three axes of the accelerometer, by trigonometry it is possible to calculate the angle of inclination of the IMU. The formulas to calculate the angles are:

        Since the angle is calculated from gravity, it is not possible to calculate the angle Z with this formula or with any other. To do this you need another component: the magnetometer, which is a type of digital compass. The MPU-6050 does not carry a magnetometer, and therefore can never accurately calculate the angle Z. However, for the vast majority of applications only the X and Y axes are needed.
        If we know the initial angle of the IMU, we can add the value that marks the gyroscope to know the new angle at each moment. Suppose we start the IMU at 0 °. If the gives us out a measurement every second, and marks 3 on the X axis, we will have the angle with this simple formula:
        
        Where elapsedTime is the time that elapses each time this formula is calculated inside of the loop, PreviousAngle is the angle calculated the last time this formula was called and GyroData is the reading of the angle Y or X of the gyroscope. And the same thing happens with all the axes. Only the Z axis is usually ignored, since when you cannot calculate an Z-angle with the Accelerometer, you can not apply a Supplementary Filter for the Z-axis. We already have the readings.
    </p>

    <h2>Noise and Errors</h2>
    <p> You have to eliminate the noise, the drift and get the accelerometer to not change its angle when it detects a force other than gravity
        One of the best is the famous Kálman Filter, which is used in aircraft, rockets and geostationary satellites.Not very practical with an Arduino
        Complementary Filter is actually a union of two different filters: a High-pass Filter for the gyroscope and a Low-pass Filter for the Accelerometer. The first lets only pass the values ​​above a certain limit, unlike the Low-pass filter, which only allows those below.
